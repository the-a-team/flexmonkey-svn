Gorilla Logic Trademark Policy
We may license certain products to you under an open source license (for example, the GNU General Public License 
(GPL)).  These open source licenses give you certain rights in our software under copyright law; however, they do not 
give you rights to use Gorilla Logic's trademarks, even if those trademarks are part of the software program we license to 
you.   This policy sets forth your rights and obligations with respect to use of Gorilla Logic's trademarks in connection with 
our software products licensed to you under an open source license. You may not use the Gorilla Logic trademarks for 
any purpose except as stated in this policy.
"Gorilla Logic," the "Gorilla Logic" logo and our other product names are trademarks of Gorilla Logic, Inc. and are 
protected under the laws of the United States and other countries. We use the Gorilla Logic trademarks to identify Gorilla 
Logic as the source and origin of Gorilla Logic products that Gorilla Logic distributes, including software product 
that Gorilla Logic distributes under an open source license. Other people are not allowed to distribute their own products 
under the Gorilla Logic trademarks. even if those products are based on or derived from Gorilla Logic software licensed 
under an open source license.  We have this policy to protect our trademarks and so that people know that, if a product 
bears a Gorilla Logic trademark, it came directly from Gorilla Logic.  When a user sees the Gorilla Logic trademarks on the 
Gorilla Logic software product, the user understands that Gorilla Logic has either created or endorsed that product, and 
that the product is subject to the quality control standards of Gorilla Logic for that product. 
If you are distributing an unmodified version of the Gorilla Logic software (meaning there have been no changes to the 
software as distributed by us) you must retain all Gorilla Logic trademarks which are set forth in the software. 
However, if you wish to distribute a modified version (a derivative work) of the Gorilla Logic software, you must remove all 
occurrences of the Gorilla Logic trademarks that are visible to users so that nobody can be confused as to whether Gorilla 
Logic, Inc. is the source or origin of your modifications or derivative works.   (Where you distribute source code, this also 
means removing all Gorilla Logic trademarks in the source code as well.)  Unless we expressly give you our permission in 
writing, you may not use the Gorilla Logic trademarks to advertise or promote your modified version.
The one exception to the rule against using our name or trademarks in modified versions of our software is as follows:  
because we still own the copyright in the portions of the software that we created, you must place, in each source file of  
your modified version and on the "splash" screen (and on the "about this software" panel) (if any), the following copyright 
notice:
Portions © Copyright Gorilla Logic, Inc.
