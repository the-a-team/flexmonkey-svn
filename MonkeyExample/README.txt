The AS class test.FlexUnitTests provides an example of how to test an application (MonkeyContacts.mxml) with FlexMonkey.To run,
open bin-debug/MonkeyContacts.html in your browser. FlexMonkey will start automatically along with the application.

To run the sample FlexUnit test, click on the FlexUnit tab in FlexMonkey and click the "Run" button. The source for the FlexUnit test is in src/test/FlexUnitTests.as.

You can record and play scripts on the "Command List" tab. The source tab will show a FlexUnit test generated from the commands currently selected in the command list.
