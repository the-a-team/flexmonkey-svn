FlexMonkeyLauncher lets you record and playback FlexMonkey tests for a swf. With FlexMonkeyLauncher, it is no longer necessary to compile your app with the FlexMonkey and automation libraries.

Copy FlexMonkeyLauncher.swf to the directory containing the swf you want to test. Please note: The launcher MUST be run from the same directory as the swf to be tested. Copy RunTests.html from the wrapper directory to this directory as well, and edit it so that it references the swf to be tested.

Open your modified RunTests.html in a browser. Once your swf is loaded, you can record and playback UI interactions. See http://code.google.com/p/flexmonkey/wiki/GettingStarted for more info.
